## Numbers

This project is about playing with numbers properties.

## Files

Each `function` file can be compiled with its matching `main` file to be used.

* [numbers.h](https://github.com/gwendalminguy/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/numbers/numbers.h), the header file containing all prototypes.

* [0-is_prime_number.c](https://github.com/gwendalminguy/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/numbers/0-is_prime_number.c), a function checking whether n is a prime number or not.

* [1-print_prime_numbers.c](https://github.com/gwendalminguy/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/numbers/1-print_prime_numbers.c), a function printing all prime numbers from 0 to a limit n.

* [2-is_perfect_number.c](https://github.com/gwendalminguy/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/numbers/2-is_perfect_number.c), a function checking whether n is a perfect number or not.

* [3-print_perfect_numbers.c](https://github.com/gwendalminguy/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/numbers/3-print_perfects_numbers.c), a function printing all perfect numbers from 0 to a limit n.

* [4-is_triangular_number.c](https://github.com/gwendalminguy/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/numbers/4-is_triangular_number.c), a function checking whether n is a triangular number or not.

* [5-print_triangular_numbers.c](https://github.com/gwendalminguy/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/numbers/5-print_triangular_numbers.c), a function printing all triangular numbers from 0 to a limit n.

* [6-is_palindromic_number.c](https://github.com/gwendalminguy/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/numbers/6-is_palindromic_number.c), a function checking whether n is a palindromic number or not.

* [7-print_palindromic_numbers.c](https://github.com/gwendalminguy/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/numbers/7-print_palindromic_numbers.c), a function printing all palindromic numbers from 0 to a limit n.

* [8-is_powerful_number.c](https://github.com/gwendalminguy/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/numbers/8-is_powerful_number.c), a function checking whether n is a powerful number or not.

* [9-print_powerful_numbers.c](https://github.com/gwendalminguy/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/numbers/9-print_powerful_numbers.c), a function printing all powerful numbers from 0 to a limit n.

## Properties
