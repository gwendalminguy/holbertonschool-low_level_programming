## Bit Manipulation

This project is about learning to manipulate bits by using bitwise operators.

## Bitwise Operators

| **Name** | **Symbol** | **Description** |
| :------- | :--------- | :-------------- |
| NOT | `~` | Returns the complement of a bit. |
| LEFT | `<<` | Shifts all the bits to the left. |
| RIGHT | `>>` | Shifts all the bits to the right. |
| AND | `&` | Returns 1 if both of the bits are 1. |
| XOR | `^` | Returns 1 if the bits ar different. |
| OR | `\|` | Returns 1 if one of the bits is 1. |
