## Recursion

This project is about learning to use recursion.

* [main.h](https://github.com/gwendalminguy/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/recursion/main.h), the header file containing all prototypes.

* [_putchar.c](https://github.com/gwendalminguy/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/recursion/_putchar.c), the definition of a custom putchar function.

* [0-puts_recursion.c](https://github.com/gwendalminguy/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/recursion/0-puts_recursion.c), a function printing a string.

* [1-print_rev_recursion.c](https://github.com/gwendalminguy/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/recursion/1-print_rev_recursion.c), a function printing a string in reverse.

* [2-strlen_recursion.c](https://github.com/gwendalminguy/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/recursion/2-strlen_recursion.c), a function computing the length of any given string.

* [3-factorial.c](https://github.com/gwendalminguy/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/recursion/3-factorial.c), a function computing the factorial of n.

* [4-pow_recursion.c](https://github.com/gwendalminguy/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/recursion/4-pow_recursion.c), a function computing x raised to the power of y.

* [5-sqrt_recursion.c](https://github.com/gwendalminguy/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/recursion/5-sqrt_recursion.c), a function computing the square root of n if.

* [6-is_prime_number.c](https://github.com/gwendalminguy/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/recursion/6-is_prime_number.c), a function checking whether n is a prime number or not.

* [7-print_prime_numbers.c](https://github.com/gwendalminguy/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/recursion/7-print_prime_numbers.c), a function printing all prime numbers from 0 to a limit n.

* [100-is_palindrome.c](https://github.com/gwendalminguy/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/recursion/100-is_palindrome.c), a function checking whether s is a palindrome or not.

* [101-wildcmp.c](https://github.com/gwendalminguy/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/recursion/101-wildcmp.c), a function comparing two strings with wildcards.
