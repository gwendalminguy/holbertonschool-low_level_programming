## Bit Manipulation

This project is about learning to manipulate bits by using bitwise operators.

* [main.h](https://github.com/gwendalminguy/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/main/bit_manipulation/main.h), the header file.

* [_putchar.c](https://github.com/gwendalminguy/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/bit_manipulation/_putchar.c), the definition of a custom putchar function.

* [0-binary_to_uint.c](https://github.com/gwendalminguy/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/main/bit_manipulation/0-binary_to_uint.c), a function converting in decimal notation a number given in binary notation.

* [1-print_binary.c](https://github.com/gwendalminguy/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/main/bit_manipulation/1-print_binary.c), a function printing in binary notation a number given in decimal notation.

* [2-get_bit.c](https://github.com/gwendalminguy/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/main/bit_manipulation/2-get_bit.c), a function getting the value of the bit at a given index for a number.

* [3-set_bit.c](https://github.com/gwendalminguy/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/main/bit_manipulation/3-set_bit.c), a function setting the bit at a given index to 1 for a number.

* [4-clear_bit.c](https://github.com/gwendalminguy/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/main/bit_manipulation/4-clear_bit.c), a function setting the bit at a given index to 0 for a number.

* [5-flip_bits.c](https://github.com/gwendalminguy/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/main/bit_manipulation/5-flip_bits.c), a function counting number of bits to flip to get from a given number to another.

* [101-password](https://github.com/gwendalminguy/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/main/bit_manipulation/101-password), the valid password for [crackme3](https://github.com/hs-hq/0x13.c/blob/main/crackme3) file.
