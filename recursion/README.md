## Recursion

This project is about learning to use recursion.

* [main.h](https://github.com/gwendalminguy/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/recursion/main.h), the header file containing all prototypes.

* [0-puts_recursion.c](https://github.com/gwendalminguy/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/recursion/0-puts_recursion.c), a function printing a string.

* [1-print_rev_recursion.c](https://github.com/gwendalminguy/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/recursion/1-print_rev_recursion.c), a function printing a string in reverse.

* [2-strlen_recursion.c](https://github.com/gwendalminguy/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/recursion/2-strlen_recursion.c), a function computing the length of any given string.

* [3-factorial.c](https://github.com/gwendalminguy/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/recursion/3-factorial.c), a function computing the factorial of n.

* [4-pow_recursion.c](https://github.com/gwendalminguy/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/recursion/4-pow_recursion.c), a function computing x raised to the power of y.

* [5-sqrt_recursion.c](https://github.com/gwendalminguy/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/recursion/5-sqrt_recursion.c), a function computing the square root of n if.

* [6-is_prime_number.c](https://github.com/gwendalminguy/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/recursion/6-is_prime_number.c), a function checking whether n is a prime number or not.
