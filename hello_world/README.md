## Hello World

This project is about learning to use the gcc compiler and some of its features (preprocessing, compiling, assembling, linking), the C syntax along with few basic functions (such as printf, puts, sizeof), return values, types and variables, and the betty coding style.

* 0-preprocessor, runs a C file through the preprocessor.

* 1-compiler, compiles a C file but does not link.

* 2-assembler, generates the assembly code of a C file.

* 3-name, compiles a C file and creates an executable named 'cisfun'.

* 4-puts.c, prints some text with function puts.

* 5-printf.c, prints some text with function printf.

* 6-size.c, prints the size of various types of variables.

* 100-intel, generates the assembly code of a C file with the Intel syntax.

* 101-quote.c, prints a message to the standard error with function write.
