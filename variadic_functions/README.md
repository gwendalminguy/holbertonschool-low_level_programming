## Variadic Functions

This project is about learning to use functions with a variable number of arguments.

* [variadic_functions.h](https://github.com/gwendalminguy/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/variadic_functions/variadic_functions.h), the header file containing all structures and prototypes.

* [0-sum_them_all.c](https://github.com/gwendalminguy/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/variadic_functions/0-sum_them_all.c), a function computing the sum of all integers it receives as arguments.

* [1-print_numbers.c](https://github.com/gwendalminguy/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/variadic_functions/1-print_numbers.c), a function printing all integers it receives as arguments.

* [2-print_strings.c](https://github.com/gwendalminguy/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/variadic_functions/2-print_strings.c), a function printing all strings it receives as arguments.

* [3-print_all.c](https://github.com/gwendalminguy/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/variadic_functions/3-print_all.c), a function printing all arguments of any type it receives.
