## Variables & Conditionals

This project is about learning to use conditionals in C (if/else, for loops, while loops), and the putchar function (with an ASCII table).

* 0-positive_or_negative.c, assigns a random number to variable n and prints its sign.

* 1-last_digit.c, assigns a random number to variable n and prints its last digit.

* 2-print_alphabet.c, prints the alphabet in lowercase.

* 3-print_alphabets.c, prints the alphabet in lowercase then in uppercase.

* 4-print_alphabt.c, prints the alphabet in lowercase except letters 'q' and 'e'.

* 5-print_numbers.c, prints all single digit numbers of base 10.

* 6-print_numberz.c, prints all single digit numbers of base 10 with function putchar.

* 7-print_tebahpla.c, prints the alphabet in lowercase in reverse.

* 8-print_base16.c, prints all the single digit numbers of base 16 in lowercase.

* 9-print_comb.c, prints all possible combinations of single digit numbers.

* 100-print_comb3.c, prints all possible different combinations of two digits.

* 101-print_comb4.c, prints all possible different combinations of three digits.

* 102-print_comb5.c, prints all possible combinations of two two-digit numbers.
